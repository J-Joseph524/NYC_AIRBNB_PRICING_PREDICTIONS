# NYC_AIRBNB_PRICING_PREDICTIONS


## Introduction:

Picked a data set of 49,000 different Airbnb's in New York City to predict the continuous variable of price.

## Objective:

Taking a look at the different features such as Room Type, Neighborhood, Minimum Nights Stayed, and Reviews to see how these independent variables impact and influence the target variable of price.

## The Dataset:

* Kaggle 

## Skills Required to Complete:

The skills used to complete this project consisted of working with Python to make visualizations using Pandas and cleaning the data set well. Also understanding & knowing how to interpret various regression models based on feature engineering & selection.

## What Was Posted on GitHub:

On GitHub I had posted three separate notebooks. One was the Final Project notebook which consisted of the Data Cleaning, Collection & Modeling components of the project and the ReadMe notebook which is a layout of how my project was presented.

## Questions I Posed:

Is there any correlation between Price & Neighborhood Group? Is there any correlation between Price & Room Type? Is there any correlation between Price & Total Number of Reviews? How can I use feature engineering to enhance my prediction model values?

## How I Put My Data Together:

First, I gathered a data set of 49,000 different Airbnb's in NYC. After I gathered the data and cleaned it, I had selected the features from the data in which I thought would most strongly correlate to the ultimate price of the Airbnb. Next, I did some EDA and decided which features I should include in my models. Following that, I had split my data into training and testing and analyzed the different values of my R^2 & RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for each model. Finally, I compared the different models to see which could predict the best price of the Airbnb.

## Future Steps I Would Have Done:

The future steps I would have taken would be to include a Ridge regression model for my data set. Another goal would have been to find another data set of even more potential features of Airbnb listings and merge the two & apply more feature engineering & selection from there.

## Recommendations Based On Analysis:

Based on my results from my analysis, I can suggest that room type is the most statistically significant feature in determining the price of an Airbnb in NYC. There are other important features that can change the total amount of the Airbnb, however the particular room type you pick is the most influential. In conclusion, the OLS model of this data set is best represented to predict pricing of your average Airbnb in New York City.
